# BunkerCoin

A revolutionary blockchain protocol designed for low-bandwidth networks and shortwave radio communication.

## Overview

BunkerCoin is a groundbreaking blockchain protocol that enables secure, decentralized transactions in bandwidth-constrained environments. By leveraging shortwave radio channels and innovative cryptographic techniques, BunkerCoin makes blockchain technology accessible in areas with limited internet connectivity.

## Key Features

- **Low Bandwidth Operation**: Optimized for transmission over shortwave radio channels
- **Shortwave Radio Compatibility**: Designed to work with 300-byte Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
- **Advanced Consensus Mechanism**: Implements a novel proof of elapsed time (PoET) verifiable delay function (VDF)
- **Secure Mining Process**: Uses recursive Poseidon hash function for "golden ticket" discovery
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Implements Groth16 proving scheme for transaction validation
- **Reliable Transmission**: 32:96 erasure coded frames over 5-minute intervals
- **Nakamoto Consensus**: Maintains network security through longest chain rule

## Technical Specifications

### Network Parameters
- Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU): 300 bytes
